*DESCRIPTION*:
This project focuses on the implementation of a machine learning-based phishing detection system to identify fake banking websites. These phishing websites are crafted to steal users' sensitive financial information like login credentials, OTPs, or bank account details.


üéØ Objectives:

‚Ä¢Build a supervised machine learning model to detect phishing in online banking portals.
‚Ä¢Analyze real-world phishing URL datasets with domain-specific features.
‚Ä¢Reduce financial fraud by flagging phishing sites early.


üß∞ Tools & Technologies Used:

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib

Platform: Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

Dataset Source: UCI Repository / PhishTank / Kaggle Phishing URLs Dataset

Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, SVM, XGBoost


‚öôÔ∏è Project Workflow:

1. Data Collection
‚Ä¢Dataset containing thousands of banking phishing and legitimate URLs.

2. Data Preprocessing
‚Ä¢Handle missing values, encode labels, scale features.

3. Model Building
‚Ä¢Train models like Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM.

4. Model Evaluation
‚Ä¢Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.

‚Ä¢Visualize with confusion matrix and ROC curve.

5. Prediction & Testing
‚Ä¢Test on unseen URLs and evaluate performance.


üîç Example Features in Banking Phishing Detection:

URL_Length

Domain_Age

Pop-up Window

Request_URL

üöÄ Future Scope:
‚Ä¢Add real-time detection using WHOIS and URL shortening services

‚Ä¢Integrate natural language processing (NLP) to analyze phishing content

‚Ä¢Train on bank-specific phishing data for higher accuracy
